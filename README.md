# Vast-ReactWeb

This repository hosts a hybrid web architecture featuring a static landing interface in the root directory and a decoupled React application within a dedicated subdirectory.

## Repository Structure

The project file system is organized as follows:

| Directory | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`/` (Root)** | Contains the static entry point (`index.html`, `script.js`, `style.css`). |
| **`/vast-react`** | Contains the source code for the React + Vite application. |
| **`/assets`** | Stores shared static resources and media assets. |

## Development Instructions

### Static Interface
The root directory comprises standard static web resources. The landing interface can be accessed by opening `index.html` in a web browser or editing the files directly in a code editor.

### React Application
The primary application logic is encapsulated within the `vast-react` directory.

**Prerequisites**
* Node.js environment.

**Installation and Execution**
Execute the following commands to initialize the development environment:

```bash
# Navigate to the application directory
cd vast-react

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Initialize the development server
npm run dev
